            <p>Chapter 1. “commencements”

There was nothing, No matter, no energy, no form, only a singularity dense and infinite, then once a great explosion of energy from infinity outwards, bedlam. It scattered particles from within and outwards of infinity, particles which would forever become stars, galaxies, and worlds.

With this was the creation of God H, which cannot be seen, heard, or tasted, the presence of God H could be felt everywhere and all around, it was the consciousness of everything and the embodiment of nothing.

In the beginning God H created, our Heavens, and our Ziemia, our Earth was formless and empty, no light nor darkness over the surface.
And God H created light and put it upon the earth, God saw the light was good he cherished it, but with only light good meant nothing, God H created darkness, God H called the dark “night” and the light “day” and with that there was evening and morning each one not only night nor only day — with the first day.

And God H created water, and he let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water. So God H made the vault and it separated the water above and under the vault. God H called the vault “sky.”
And it was as such. — the second day.

God H let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear. And it was such. God called the dry ground “land” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw it was neutral.

Then God H created vegetation, seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seeds.</p>
